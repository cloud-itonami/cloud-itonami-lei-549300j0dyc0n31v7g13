[ADR-2607110300](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607110300-cloud-itonami-lei-corporate-tos-catalog.md)
(`cloud-itonami-lei-corporate-tos-catalog`, `com-junkawasaki/root`). It is a read-only

  carrying `:tos/full-text`, `:tos/source-url`, `:tos/retrieved-at`, `:tos/sha256`,
  `:tos/doc-type`, and a `:tos/supersedes` chain for future revisions.

## Design rationale

See ADR-2607110300 in `com-junkawasaki/root` (`90-docs/adr/`) for why this repo exists,
why it is keyed by LEI rather than GTIN or ticker, and why full-text archival (with
provenance) was chosen over excerpt-only storage.
